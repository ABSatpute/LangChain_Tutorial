In seasoned wood, the story lies,
Of sages strong, with steadfast eyes.
A weapon once, a yogiâ€™s friend,
Where power and patience softly blend.

Swing by swing, the spirit flows,
Strength within the body grows.
Balance, grace, and breath unite,
Turning labor into light.

From akharas old to modern ground,
Its timeless echoes still resound.
Not just a tool, but art refined,
A mudgar shapes both flesh and mind.
